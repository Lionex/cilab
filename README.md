# Computational Inteligence Lab

_Florida State University, Department of Scientific Computing_

The computational intelligence lab at the department of scientific computing has a strong theoretical basis in neural networks developed over the past two years, though no papers yet.  The computational intelligence seminar hopes to develop the knowledge and experience of various members of our department, with special focus on the latest neural network developments in industry.
